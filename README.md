# Team-757
MediSphere for remote care of patients
# problem statement
Creating secure, scalable telemedicine platforms for
virtual consultations, chronic disease management ,
and post-operativeÂ follow-ups.

# our thought
"Existing telemedicine platforms are fragmented and lack a patient-centric approach. We focus on delivering a seamless, patient-first solution without unnecessaryÂ complexity."

# Medisphere â€“ A Patient-First Telemedicine Revolution
Medisphere is more than just a telemedicine platformâ€”itâ€™s a complete, patient-centric solution. With virtual consultations, smart doctor matching, caretaker support, seamless communication, and secure health tracking, we simplify healthcare and put patients first. No complexity,Â justÂ care.

## Future Development

### Symptom-Based Doctor Redirection
Using AI-powered symptom checking, patients will be redirected to the appropriate specialist. For example, if a patient reports heart-related symptoms, they will be directed to a cardiologist.

### Myth Busters
Health myths can be extremely dangerous. To combat misinformation, doctors will be able to upload Myth Bustersâ€”fact-checked medical insightsâ€”so that any patient can access and learn from them.

## Report Management and AI Integration
All medical reports will be stored in one place for easy access. In the future, by applying the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, we can suggest relevant Myth Busters to patients based on their medical history and reports.
